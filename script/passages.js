    title: 'Sonnet 29',
    content: `When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
      I all alone beweep my outcast state,
      And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
      And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
      Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
      Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,
      Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
      With what I most enjoy contented least;
      Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
      Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
      Like to the lark at break of day arising
      From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
      For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings
      That then I scorn to change my state with kings.`,

    title: 'Sonnet 18',
    content: `Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
      And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
      Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
      And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
      And every fair from fair sometime declines,
      By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
      But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
      Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
      Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
      When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
      So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
      So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.`,

    title: 'Eye for Eye',
    content: `“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.`,
