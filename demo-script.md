After working on your script in the passage tab, you could try training in line by line mode. In line by line mode, byHeart uses line breaks and punctuation to parse the passage into smaller chunks. This allows you to focus on one line at a time. Start training, read each line alloud and each time you work your way through the passage, you can increase or decrease the difficulty. If you get stuck, you can hover your mouse over a word. ByHeart slowly begins to fill in the missing letters. When you get to the end of your passage, you can see how much time this round took. You can even save your times and see your progress...
