ByHeart is a tool to help people memorize monologues, text passages, and other material. By removing letters from the words incrementally, reading the material becomes more difficult. The user must concentrate to recall the words in the passage, instead of just reading them. Over time, this facilitates memorization of the passage. 

Users can practice recalling the passage one line at a time. If they are stuck, they can mouse over a word to get a hint. The app can record the time and difficulty for each recitation, and present the data in a graph.
